# PasswordChecker
This program will check how secure your password is.
        After you run the code you type the password you want to check how secure it is.
        then you have to confirm whether this was the correct password you wanted to type, type yes if it was it is not case sensitive,
        anything else will register as no. Then it will check it. Hope you enjoy! :)
